<div class="question">What is PlayTF2's ranking system?</div>
<div class="answer">
Our ranking system is a unique system not seen on any Source server before. It approximates a person's relative playing skill based off of the popular rating system <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">Elo</a>. The environment is then normalized with respect to total play time and kills; thus preventing farming and ensuring that all gamers have an equal chance to be the top of the ranking

<div class="question">How can I boost my ranking?</div>
<div class="answer">
The easiest way to boost your ranking is to play better. Our system looks at serveral factors when approximating relative skill. Some of these factors are:

<ul><li>* Amount of team changes</li><li> * Winning Percentage and Kill to Death ratio</li><li>* Teamplay Abilities</li></ul>
</div>

<div class="question">How do you measure Teamplay Ability?</div>
<div class="answer">
Our ranking system runs on a smart and adaptive algorithm that observes and learns as the game progresses while monitoring patterns and habits. The system then processes this information and predicts 'key events' based off the monitored history. For example, dynamic gamers that contribute to victories in the game by defending or attacking multiple key locations are favored. The game is dynamic, thus the system expects the best gamers to be dynamic as well. This is to discourage spawn camping and farming.
